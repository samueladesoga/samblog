      <description>I have always resolved to using xpath whenever i am creating selenium scripts and i need to do locate elements with no &amp;lsquo;id&amp;rsquo;. Well as you would probably know, xpath executes so slow on IE.
For intance i have a test suite that would run in 1hr 30mins on firefox/ safari but the same test suites would take over 4hrs to run to completion on IE.So with the help of a colleagues, i have been using css selectors from last week and i can say this has drastically improved the speed of our test and you would notice too much difference between IE and FF/Safari anymore.</description>
