      <description>I ran into a situation today where i wanted to scan through a page and return a table based on the table matching 3 attributes
Before:
browser.tables.find do |table|
table.class_name == &amp;lsquo;my_class_name&amp;rsquo; and
table.cell(:class, &amp;lsquo;class_1_name&amp;rsquo;).text == &amp;lsquo;some_text_1&amp;rsquo; and
table.cell(:class, &amp;lsquo;class_2_name&amp;rsquo;).text == &amp;lsquo;some_text_2&amp;rsquo;
end
This was taking about 3minutes as there were about 86tables on this page under test. I was worried but the tables on this page was gonna increase with time which meant the time for this stage of the test was bound to increase.</description>

      <description>In recent days been doing a lot of ruby, which means i tend to use Active Record as well.
I had written some scripts where i was selecting records that matched a criteria such as:
@table1.table2s.select{|e| e.column_name == 1234} but as i need to sort my result and also give some more conditions to filter the data, i need alternatives to this above query and i ended up with the two lines of code below:</description>
