      <description>&amp;gt;In a previous post, i have written about how i have been starting/ stoping the selenium server dynamically. What i didnt mention was that i was not able to run my tests using Internet Explorer. I got this error
[sourcecode language=&amp;ldquo;java&amp;rdquo;]

      <description>&amp;gt;I have been working on a test suite in java using testng as the testing framework. I could not have suggested any other test frame work as it allows me to do a lot of configurable setups and teardowns. Yeah am not gonna promote testng anymore, lol.
I could have started using selenium server using a usual batch file that maven could call in one of its targets but i think doing it this way is cleaner.</description>
