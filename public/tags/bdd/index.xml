      <description>So I have used quite a number of tools in my time building test automation frameworks over the years; and in the last 2years i have evaluatedÂ a number of these tools and i am becoming more and more opinionated in my choice of tools.
For someone that has used selenium/webdriver and cucumber a lot in the past, i find myself using Geb and Spock these days and it hasnt been much difficulty in switch to these tools.</description>

      <description>I ran into a problem today where some french and spanish characters were being displayed strangely.
And this made my test to fail,
After some poking around in google i can across a post that suggested adding
require &amp;lsquo;cucumber/formatter/unicode&amp;rsquo;
to the env.rb and that seem to have sorted the problems i was having.
Hopes this saves you some time.</description>

      <description>In my the few years, where i have pushed for testers developers to write acceptance test before development or implementation commences, I&amp;rsquo;ve had testers come up to me say its difficult to achieve this when you dont know what the UI would look like.
This post would attempt to decribe how i have done this in the past and i still do this at the moment.
NB: Ideally i would write my test using page object pattern, if this was a new project, I would start creating page objects</description>

The application i am testing is an e-commerce site and i am writing test for a page on which i click on an item and the item appears on the shopping basket area of the site.

[code]
def select_item(item_name) @browser.li(:text =&amp;gt; /#{item_name}/).link(:class_name =&amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;addOptions&amp;rdquo;).click Watir::Wait.</description>

      <title>A tester&#39;s reflection on kanban plus BDD</title>

      <description>Having just finished an engagement with a client where the development practices include kanban and BDD. Kanban for us meant that we give priority to work on the right side of the board. So as a tester, I would rather spend my time doing some manual testing on a story that is in the QA queue, than writing automated acceptance tests for a story in the queue for Acceptance Tests.</description>

      <title>Blank cells in step tables in cucumber 0.3.11 is represented as nil</title>

      <description>In my current job, I have been doing a lot of acceptance test using Cucumber, Watir and RSpec, obvious all in Ruby. I have been using Cucumber 0.6.x, in which blank cells in the step table are represented by empty string (&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;). This was okay for me until today when i had to use a previous version of Cucumber 0.3.11 due to reasons including compatibility with other projects in the CI build.</description>
