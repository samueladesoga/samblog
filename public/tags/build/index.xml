      <description>Actually started the task by attempting to use MSBuild to deploy my application to a remote server.
which would require some secure means, scp, sftp or something of that sort.
The closest i got was SSHSharp which was written by a third party and not thoroughly tested,
i then decided maybe that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the path to go.
Tried to go for Nant instead, and found that Nant core doesnt have a task for secure copy,</description>
