      <description>&amp;gt;In my new job been doing a lot of selenium and i needed to scroll through the list of
options in a select element and click on a particular options.
i have initially used the browser.DoubleClick
browser.DoubleClick(&amp;ldquo;xpath=//select/option[child::text()=&amp;lsquo;Option_Label&amp;rsquo;]&amp;ldquo;);)
But then this didnt work because selenium doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the functionality to scroll down the select element in other to make my desired option visible.
Looking through the selenium api, i have used another method, which take in two parameters, the select locator and the option locator.</description>
