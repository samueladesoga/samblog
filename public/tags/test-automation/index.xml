      <title>Should API test and UI Acceptance Tests be written in the same programming language?</title>

      <description>I have written in my previous blog about how we need to distribute our tests across the testing pyramid for reasons which i have explained in the previous blog. This particular post is focussed on how we ought to design our tests across the higher levels of abstractions which includes the UI test and API tests.
For the purpose of the blog, I would be using a case study of team that writes its UI Acceptance tests in protractor (Javascript) and the API tests in Java using RestAssured library.</description>

      <title>Testing an Asynchronous System - Part 2</title>

      <description>In this post, I would like to consider how to write automated tests for negative scenarios for a system built using an asynchronous / event driven architecture. In my previous post, i have mentioned, that these systems are peculiar because the effect of the &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; actions are not immediately stored in the persistence layer of the application under test.
As an example, in the current system which i have been testing on the write side of the application, the write commands traverses though the Command API layer, the command controller layer and the command Handler layer before it ends up in the Event Store.</description>

      <description>In recent months i have been testing a system built using the CQRS pattern. CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation and you can read more about it here.
As a tester, one of the key takeaway for me is that there is a Read side and a Write side to the application. This is very different to the other applications that i have tested in the past where a write operation would NOT be successfully until the data being sent to the application is successfully persisted.</description>

      <description>So I have used quite a number of tools in my time building test automation frameworks over the years; and in the last 2years i have evaluatedÂ a number of these tools and i am becoming more and more opinionated in my choice of tools.
For someone that has used selenium/webdriver and cucumber a lot in the past, i find myself using Geb and Spock these days and it hasnt been much difficulty in switch to these tools.</description>

      <description>This post is spurned by taking a reflection on my journey as a tester and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see how much i have moved from designing large UI test suites to very small UI test suites. For emphasis, the largest test suite had taken over 8 hrs and the smallest has been 3mins of execution time. There are a lot of posts on the internet about how fragile a UI test framework could be and i would expect the next question to be how have you been able to achieve this.</description>

      <description>A colleague asked me how to automate a disabled text-box which has a calendar attached to it. The customer has specified that they want keyboard entries disabled for this text-field, hence every user of the website has to use the calendar drop down.
Previously, this has been automated by using webdriver to type the text into the text box but as it was disabled, this was impossible.
imagine, this is the html for the textbox:</description>

      <description>I ran into a problem today where some french and spanish characters were being displayed strangely.
And this made my test to fail,
After some poking around in google i can across a post that suggested adding
require &amp;lsquo;cucumber/formatter/unicode&amp;rsquo;
to the env.rb and that seem to have sorted the problems i was having.
Hopes this saves you some time.</description>

      <description>In my last blog post, i described how i have used jmeter-plugins at my current client site, now i am faced with another problem , i need to be able to run these performance test from command line, in other for these performance tests to be executed in a CI environment such as teamcity.
A quick search brings to light the ant jmeter task which is an ant task for running jmeter test.</description>

      <description>Jmeter is a well known open source performance/load testing tool and to be fair it does a lot of stuff really well. if you wants to do some quick performance testing without a whole lots of infrastructure around it then it is great.
I started out my task with jmeter with some objectives:
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt; A tool that i could integrate into a CI tool such as teamcity&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; Meaningful graphs that could be easily interpreted by any one in the team&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; Able to integrate the graphs into teamcity&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; Able to monitor the performance of the website under test.</description>

      <description>A colleague came across this problem while executing our acceptance tests.
The issue was related to the fact that the SSL certificate for the site was named differently from the domain on which the test were being executed on .
Hence, we got this error:
&amp;ldquo;xxx.xxx.xxxx uses an invalid security certificate.The certificate does not come from a trusted source.The certificate is only valid for &amp;lt;a id=&amp;ldquo;cert_domain_link&amp;rdquo; title=&amp;ldquo;xxx.xxx.com&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;xxxx.xxxxx.com&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;The certificate will not be valid until 13-Jul-11 10:28 AM.</description>

      <description>In my the few years, where i have pushed for testers developers to write acceptance test before development or implementation commences, I&amp;rsquo;ve had testers come up to me say its difficult to achieve this when you dont know what the UI would look like.
This post would attempt to decribe how i have done this in the past and i still do this at the moment.
NB: Ideally i would write my test using page object pattern, if this was a new project, I would start creating page objects</description>

The application i am testing is an e-commerce site and i am writing test for a page on which i click on an item and the item appears on the shopping basket area of the site.
My code look like
[code]

      <description>I was helping a friend out last weekend, and he was getting an error
java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not start Selenium session: Failed to start new browser session: Error while launching browser
at com.thoughtworks.selenium.DefaultSelenium.start(DefaultSelenium.java:89)
This was strange because looking at his code everything seem to be properly set up, i did some debugging andÂ IÂ discovered that the session in the selenium object was null, this suggested that weÂ weren&amp;rsquo;tÂ initializing the selenium object properly.</description>

      <description>I have heard people have problems with starting firefox3 while using selenium1.0.x on windows7.
The exact error message is similar to this: java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not start Selenium session: Failed to start new browser session: java.lang.RuntimeException: Firefox 3 could not be found in the path!
Please add the directory containing &amp;ldquo;firefox.exe&amp;rdquo; to your PATH environment
variable, or explicitly specify a path to Firefox 3 like this:
*firefox3c:\blah\firefox.exe
at com.thoughtworks.selenium.DefaultSelenium.start(DefaultSelenium.java:89) I attempted to fix this by putting the path in the environment variable ofÂ theÂ windows7 machine and it still did not work.</description>

      <description>I had the opportunity to attend the selenium conference and loads of good stuff, i must tell you. This post is an attempt to highlight the conference talks/ seminar that i really enjoyed.
 Page Object 101: This was a workshop delivered by Patrick Wilson Welsh and Adam Goucher. Even though I have done a lot of page objects in the past, at a glance i like the way patrick has approached html elements, (wraping each html elements in a class), it feels like writing selenium code in a watir way.</description>

      <description>Having just finished an engagement with a client where the development practices include kanban and BDD. Kanban for us meant that we give priority to work on the right side of the board. So as a tester, I would rather spend my time doing some manual testing on a story that is in the QA queue, than writing automated acceptance tests for a story in the queue for Acceptance Tests.</description>

      <description>I ran into a situation today where i wanted to scan through a page and return a table based on the table matching 3 attributes
Before:
browser.tables.find do |table|
table.class_name == &amp;lsquo;my_class_name&amp;rsquo; and
table.cell(:class, &amp;lsquo;class_1_name&amp;rsquo;).text == &amp;lsquo;some_text_1&amp;rsquo; and
table.cell(:class, &amp;lsquo;class_2_name&amp;rsquo;).text == &amp;lsquo;some_text_2&amp;rsquo;
end
This was taking about 3minutes as there were about 86tables on this page under test. I was worried but the tables on this page was gonna increase with time which meant the time for this stage of the test was bound to increase.</description>

I have been using Cucumber 0.6.x, in which blank cells in the step table are represented by empty string (&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;). This was okay for me until today when i had to use a previous version of Cucumber 0.3.11 due to reasons including compatibility with other projects in the CI build.</description>

However after knocking up a few test i discovered that my test would not run in my version of firefox (3.5). I got this error:

Well i needed to match the single digit in this string &amp;ldquo;home-area-1&amp;rdquo; and return this digit. With a quick google i found this piece of code here.
Pattern p = Pattern.compile(&amp;ldquo;a*b&amp;rdquo;);
Matcher m = p.matcher(&amp;ldquo;aaaaab&amp;rdquo;);

I could have started using selenium server using a usual batch file that maven could call in one of its targets but i think doing it this way is cleaner.</description>

      <description>I have always resolved to using xpath whenever i am creating selenium scripts and i need to do locate elements with no &amp;lsquo;id&amp;rsquo;. Well as you would probably know, xpath executes so slow on IE.
For intance i have a test suite that would run in 1hr 30mins on firefox/ safari but the same test suites would take over 4hrs to run to completion on IE.So with the help of a colleagues, i have been using css selectors from last week and i can say this has drastically improved the speed of our test and you would notice too much difference between IE and FF/Safari anymore.</description>

      <description>I have been working on a selenium test suite that contains about 150 tests. These test would normally take about 4hrs 30mins for it to execute to completion.
I tried to run same tests on Safari today, and it took exactly 1hr 9min. This is such a big difference and i think it is because of the extreme use of Xpath in the test suite. And as it is known thatXpath execute soooo slow in IE.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt;Waiting for a page to load while writing selenium scripts is pretty straightforward using the
selenium.WaitForPageToLoad(&amp;ldquo;timeout&amp;rdquo;) timeout is time in millisecond.
Sometimes using this command doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, especially when you the whole page is not loaded or reloaded but a popup is loaded in a div on the page. In situation like this i would used the
selenium.WaitForCondition(&amp;rdquo;ScriptToReturnwhich ReturnTrue OrFalse&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;timeout&amp;rdquo;);
e.g. of scripts would be
selenium.WaitForCondition(selenium.browserbot.get CurrentWindow().document
.getElement ById(&amp;lsquo;idOfElement ToBelocated&amp;rsquo;)!</description>

      <description>I was in this situation when i needed to get the value of an html attribute and i found the selenium.getattribute very handy &amp;hellip;..
Okay the scenario was such that there was an element which is collapsible on the page and the only attibute for that element that indictated the status of the collapsible element was the &amp;lsquo;Class&amp;rsquo;. when the element was collapsed, the value of the class attribute was &amp;lsquo;asleep&amp;rsquo; and when the element was expanded, the value of the class atttribute was &amp;lsquo;awake&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt;The task at hand was to navigate through the DOM of a particular webpage and check the
style.display attribute of an object or element if you prefer. There are two elements on this page that displayed either success or failure messages.(msgSuccess and msgFailed)
For perfomance reasons, if previously a successful message was displayed and subsequently the you get a failure message, what the developers of the page did was to amend the style.</description>

      <description>I just stunbled across selenium as a tool to take screenshot.
Thuis could be useful for anything.
In my case i used it to take the screenshot of a page just before it throws an error in my selenium test. and that i could have a look and investigate what the problem might have been.
very simple command and the great thing is it can be easily used for screenshots of a page across different browsers.</description>

      <title>Selenium and Javascript events</title>

      <description>Have you ver been in situattion when you have typed a value into a text box and you expect a Javascript event to be triggered such as âOnBlurâ
Well selenium has a method âFireEventâ which triggers the event for you, but then the trick is you have to strip the âonâ and name for the event wouldbe âOnBlurâ
I guess abit of example would make more sense, lol. This is what my html look like</description>
