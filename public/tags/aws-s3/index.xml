      <description>I have recently taken on ownership of a website and as part of the migration task i&amp;rsquo;ve had to copy over a few artefacts;I will be posting another blog about what i have learnt from this process.
The website uses Amazon s3 for storing users&amp;rsquo; uploaded photos and document. I was faced with the task of copying these files over to my S3 account. Quite a number of ways to achieve this; but i stumbled on a link which is a python script that copies object between two buckets in the same account.</description>
