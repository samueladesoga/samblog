      <description>For some time i have been trying to automate a desktop application which uses a lot of DevExpress controls. For someone coming from a web application environment; this wasÂ a very difficult task for me as i had no experience of WPF or any of the other custom controls framework out there.
So that i dont have to repeat myself i would post a link to the post i put on the devexpress website but i hope to flesh out a detail blog post sometime in the future so that other people can learn from me.</description>
