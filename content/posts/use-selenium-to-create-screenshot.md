&gt;I just stunbled across selenium as a tool to take screenshot.<br />Thuis could be useful for anything.<br /><br />In my case i used it to take the screenshot of a page just before it throws an error in my selenium test. and that i could have a look and investigate what the problem might have been.<br /><br />very simple command and the great thing is it can be easily used for screenshots of a page across different browsers.<br /><br />browser.CaptureEntirePageScreenshot("C:\\actual _path_to_where_you_want the_file _placed\\screenshot.png");
