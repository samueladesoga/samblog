The invite sent to me,looks like this :<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Doing a bit of google got me <a href="http://forums.techguy.org/business-applications/584211-outlook-2003-cannot-accept-meetings.html">this</a> <a href="http://forums.techguy.org/business-applications/584211-outlook-2003-cannot-accept-meetings.html">link</a>, and it worked for me<br /><br />Just incase the link goes down some day, here is what you need to do<br /><br />1.
