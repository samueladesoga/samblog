&gt;yeah so in all these year, i have always resolved to using xpath whenever i am creating selenium scripts and i need to do stuff with element that have no id. well as you would probably know, xpath executes so slow on IE.<br /><br />For intance i have a test suite that would run in 1hr 30mins on firefox/ safari but the same test suites would take over 4hrs to run to completion on IE.<br /><br />So with the help of a colleagues, i have been using css selectors from last week and i can say this has drastically improved the speed of our test and you would notice too much difference between IE and FF/Safari anymore.<br /><br />It takes some time to get used to but these are some link that might be useful to get start with ....<br /><br /><ul><li> A summary or cheat sheet could be found <a href="http://www.princexml.com/doc/6.0/selectors/">here</a></li><li>Other links are: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html">W3C CSS2</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/">W3C CSS3</a></li></ul>Enjoy .....
