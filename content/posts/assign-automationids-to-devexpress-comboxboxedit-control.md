<p>For some time i have been trying to automate a desktop application which uses a lot of DevExpress controls. For someone coming from a web application environment; this was  a very difficult task for me as i had no experience of WPF or any of the other custom controls framework out there.</p><p>So that i dont have to repeat myself i would post a link to the post i put on the devexpress website but i hope to flesh out a detail blog post sometime in the future so that other people can learn from me. </p><p>http://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/Q452914/focus-answer-ee71c273-5f00-11e2-bf12-f0bf97cd2df9</p><p> </p>
