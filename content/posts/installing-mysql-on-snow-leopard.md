&gt;I have always struggled with install mysql on my snow leopard, as a result i have decided to keep a link on this blog for this:<br /><br />http://www.icoretech.org/2009/08/install-mysql-and-mysql-ruby-gem-on-snow-leopard-64-bit/<br /><br /><br />Hopefully that link would be up for a very long time and i hope it is useful for someone else as well.
