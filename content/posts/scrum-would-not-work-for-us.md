“Scrum would never work for us here.”  

It’s a phrase I’ve heard countless times, and it often reflects a deeper resistance to change or a misunderstanding of what Scrum truly is. While it’s true that Scrum isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, it’s an incredibly powerful framework for teams focused on product delivery. When implemented correctly, Scrum can transform how teams work, prioritise, and deliver value.  

So, why do so many teams struggle with Scrum? In my experience, the resistance often boils down to three key issues:  
1. The inability to prioritise, leading to too much “work in progress” and a lack of focus.  
2. A lack of understanding about goal-setting and how it impacts team morale and productivity.  
3. A lack of trust between the team and its stakeholders.  

Ironically, these are the very reasons why Scrum can be so effective. Let’s explore how Scrum addresses these challenges, particularly through the lens of goal-setting.

**The Power of Goals: Product and Sprint Goals**

In 2020, the Scrum Guide explicitly introduced the concepts of Product Goals and Sprint Goals, and for good reason. These goals serve as the North Star for teams, providing clarity, focus, and a shared sense of purpose.  

**Why Goals Matter**

Goals aren’t just nice-to-haves; they’re essential for effective product delivery. They:  
- Provide a clear focus for the team and stakeholders.  
- Help track progress and measure success.  
- Align everyone around a common purpose.  

Yet, many teams get this backward. They start by defining the “what” (the tasks or backlog items) and then try to retrofit a “why” (the goal) around them. This approach often leads to confusion, misalignment, and wasted effort.  

The Scrum Framework flips this around. It encourages teams to start with the “why”—the compelling reason behind the work—and then use that to define the “what.” In other words, create the goal first, and then let the goal drive the creation of the product backlog items.  

This logic applies to both the **Product Goal** (intermediate objective) and the **Sprint Goal** (tactical objective). Together, they create a roadmap that guides the team’s efforts and ensures alignment with stakeholder expectations.

**Creating Goals Through Collaboration**

One of the most common misconceptions about Scrum is that goals are dictated from the top down. In reality, effective goal-setting is a collaborative process that involves the entire team and its stakeholders.  

**Product Goals**

The Product Goal is the overarching objective that the team is working toward. It’s not something the Product Owner dreams up in isolation. Instead, it starts as a suggestion or idea, which is then refined and finalised through collaboration with stakeholders—including the developers. This ensures the goal is both ambitious and achievable.  

**Sprint Goals**

Similarly, the Sprint Goal is a stepping stone toward the Product Goal. It’s not handed down to the team; it’s co-created during Sprint Planning. The team discusses the objective, evaluates its feasibility, and commits to delivering it by the end of the Sprint.  

This collaborative approach fosters a sense of ownership and accountability. When everyone has a hand in creating the goals, they’re more likely to be invested in achieving them.


One argument against adopting Scrum is the desire to juggle multiple goals simultaneously. While this could be a valid concern, there are strategies to mitigate it:  
1. **Shorten the Timebox**: Reduce the timebox for the Product Goal, say,  from three months to one month. This makes the goal more manageable and allows for quicker feedback loops.  
2. **Broaden the Goal**: Create a broader goal that delivers significant value within the chosen timebox. This ensures the team stays focused without feeling overwhelmed.  

These strategies help teams maintain clarity and momentum, even when faced with competing priorities.


**The Role of Trust and Focus**

Scrum isn’t just about processes and goals; it’s about people. For Scrum to work, teams need trust, support, and the freedom to focus.  

**Trust:** When stakeholders trust the team to deliver on their commitments, it creates a positive feedback loop. The team feels empowered, and stakeholders see consistent results.  
**Focus:** Teams perform best when they can concentrate on their goals without constant interruptions. This means setting aside dedicated capacity for unplanned tasks (like regulatory or compliance work) while ensuring the majority of the team’s effort goes toward achieving their Sprint and Product Goals.  

Over time, teams that embrace ambitious yet feasible goals develop higher morale and a stronger sense of purpose. They become more self-managing, productive, and aligned with users’ needs.

**Conclusion: Making Scrum Work for You**

The phrase “Scrum would never work for us here” often stems from a lack of understanding or misapplication of the framework. But when implemented correctly—with a focus on collaboration, goal-setting, and trust—Scrum can be a game-changer for product delivery teams.  

If your team is struggling with prioritisation, alignment, or morale, consider trying Scrum. Start by defining clear, compelling goals. Involve your team and stakeholders in the process. Most importantly, create an environment where trust and focus can thrive.  

Scrum isn’t a magic bullet but a powerful tool for building agility and delivering value. The question isn’t whether Scrum can work for you—it’s whether you’re willing to embrace the principles that make it work.
