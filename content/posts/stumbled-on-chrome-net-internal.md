Sometime i would use my blog as a place to keep interesting stuff for future exploration.

I came across the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/view-net-internals" target="_blank">chrome net internals</a> today and i think it exposes a lot of useful information that might be useful to testers when testing a web application.

To access the chrome net internals, navigate to chrome://net-internals/ on a google chrome browser.

I would be spending some more time in the future exploring this but for now its back to work.

Enjoy!!!
