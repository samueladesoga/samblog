In the latest version of the Scrum Guide, these words (Usable, Useful and Valuable) appear in a number of instances and its very easy to use these work interchangeably.
Useful, Usable and Valuable should not be used interchangeably and  this is an attempts to document my thoughts following conversations I had with some peers in the Scrum community.

{{< quote author="Sam Adesoga">}}
For a product to be useful, it must be usable; and for a product to be valuable, it must be useful.

##### Usable

For a product, Usability is ability to "physically" use that product and there is a closely associated measure for Usability know as "Ease of Use".
A mobile browser can be said to be "Usable" because a user can close a mobile window ny the use of a "swipe" gesture; if the feature to close a window wasn't implemented,
then a user will be stuck on the current window and as a result, that could be a defect in the product.

In the scrum guide, there are multiple mentions of a Usable Increment as an outcome of a Sprint which imply that the "Definition of Done" must include conditions to ensure 
a Usable Increment.

##### Useful

Usefulness means to "find a use" for a feature or product. Referring to the example above for a mobile phone, closing or minimising a window allows a user to switch between multiple 
windows on their phone. I cannot imagine how a product can be Useful without being Usable, hence the reason I belive that for a product to be Useful, it must be usable.

##### Valuable

A useful product can be Valuable when its purposed users validates the value that it provides.There many facets to defining Value but for the purpose of the article, I would like to focus 
more on Value from the point of View of a Customer. 

Lets consider an example:

Whatsapp could be useful because a user is able to send text, audio and video to their contacts but the Value could be allows its' users to stay connected to their loved one.

In Scrum, the Scrum Team and its stakeholders should devise techniques to validate that Value is being delivered each Sprint.
