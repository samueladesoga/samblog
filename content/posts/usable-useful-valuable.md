In the latest version of the Scrum Guide, these words (Usable, Useful and Valuable) appear in a number of instances and its very easy to use these work interchangeably.
Useful, Usable and Valuable should not be used interchangeably and  this is an attempt to document my thoughts following conversations I had with some peers in the Scrum community.

For a product to be useful, it must be usable; and for a product to be valuable, it must be useful.

##### Usable
For a product, A usable product is one that is fit for use and there is a closely associated measure for Usability known as "Ease of Use".

On a mobile phone, a browser can referred to be "Usable" because a user can minimise a browser using a gestures such as the swipe. If the browser is missing such a feature, then this could referred as a defect and in effect the browser is not usable. (Note: This is debatable, as a user could still browse but just not able to do anything else.)

In the scrum guide, there are multiple mentions of a Usable Increment as an outcome of a Sprint which implies that the "Definition of Done" must include conditions to ensure a Usable Increment is created for each Sprint.

##### Useful

Usefulness means to "find a use" for a feature or product. Referring to the example above for a mobile phone, minimising a window is the "Usability" allows a user to switch between multiple 
windows on their phone. 

The usability part is "ability to minimise a browser" and this is useful for "switching between different browsers".

I cannot imagine how a product can be Useful without being Usable, hence the reason I belive that for a product to be Useful, it must be usable.

##### Valuable

There many facets to defining Value but for the purpose of the article, I would like to focus more on Value from the point of View of a Customer. In the mobile browser example, the Value could be that the ability to switch between multiple browser windows helps to increase efficiency and saves users' time.

###### Lets consider another example - WhatsApp

Whatapps is an instant messaging tool that we all use.

Whatsapp is Usable because we can launch and use all the feature in the application.

Its usefulness come from the users ability to send text, audio and video to their contacts but the Value could be that it helps users to stay connected to their loved ones.

In Scrum, the Scrum Team and its stakeholders should devise techniques to validate that Value is being delivered each Sprint.
