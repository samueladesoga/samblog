&gt;Faced with the reality of having to hand in my MAC to my former workplace, i decided to buy a Windows machine (HP 6735s Laptop, AMD Athlon TM X2 Dual Core QL-60 1.9Ghz, 4GB memory, 250GB HDD, DVD+-RW SMDL LightScribe writer, Webcam 15.4" WXGA (1280 x 800) WLAN Bluetooth Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium )<br /><br />and being a MAC - convert, coupled with the numerous negative feedback about Vista. I have installed Ubuntu Hardy Heron on a seperate partition. For some reason i have been spending about 4hours each day trying to sort Ubuntu to recognise my hardware, the first was my wireless wasnt working, ubuntu did not recognise the Broadcom wireless hardware which the laptop.<br /><br />I am not gonna start copying stuff, there is a lot of blogs out there, two which helped me are:<br />http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=766560<br />https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff#head-bc33832c0547766a33c3a84f13f971ca757b2851<br /><br />Well my wireless now work , the next huddle is to get the Microphone to work, so i should get that done next week, if i get some time to get round to it.
