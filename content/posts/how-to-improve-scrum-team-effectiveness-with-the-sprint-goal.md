The commitments contained in the  Scrum Artifacts are arguably one of the important element of the Scrum Framework;  these commitments when deployed as per the intentions of the scrum framework contributes increase the effectiveness of the scrum team. 


I was asked to help out a Scrum Team that did not see much value out of a  well crafted Sprint Goal for their Sprints. In the sprint planing, the team would rollover every product backlog item (PBI) that was not completed in the last sprint, and the team would add a few more product backlog items from their backlog on the ask of the team manager, who also attended the Sprint Planning regularly. Evidence provided in their 
product backlog managemenr tool showed that the team had not for once completed all the PBIs in their sprint backlog in the last 6 - 9 months.

Over the years, I have observed the negative impacts of failing to achieve set goals can have a negative impact on teams. Impact would vary from feelings of disappointment, frustration among team members, decrease in motivation and morale among many others. With this team that i was called to coached, goals were not explicitly set, however there was an implicit goals to attempt to complete every PBIs selected for the sprint; and when i spoke to team members i could sense some frustration and overall lack of motivation.


A well crafted sprint goal could do this scrum team a lot of good and below are 5 ways the sprint goals could help increase the effectiveness of team:

1. **Less time spent in the Sprint Planning:** The introduction of the Sprint Goals provides focus during the sprint planning. A scrum team without a Sprint Goal will probably keep planning until the time-box allowed for the Sprint Planning is expired. However, when a team plans using a Sprint Goals, the Sprint planning can be ended when the Scrum team has selected enough PBIs to deliver the Sprint Goal up to the capacity of the Developers for the next Sprint.

2. **Fosters collaboration within the team:** In this particular scrum team, the developers agreed that they did not communicate through the sprint as there was no crossovers in their tasks. Now that most of the PBIs collectively delivers the Sprint Goal; there is an incentive for the Scrum team to work together closely to ensure that the Sprint Goal is delivered. The developers communicate more frequently during the sprint and support each other to get PBIs assigned to each other done. 

3. **Inspection during the Daily Scrum:** The Scrum team i was support did not find value in the Daily Scrum and there was a good argument not to as the developers werent working together as a team. With the introduction of a Sprint Goal, the scrum team has the opportunity to improve the effectiveness of its daily scrum by using a facilitation technique that allows it to inspect the progress toward the Sprint Goal on a daily basis. This practice reinforces the purpose of the sprint to the developers and increases the likelihood of delivering the sprint goal.   

4. **Improves Focus during the sprint:** Occasionally the developers are pulled into the projects in the organisation; other times, the over zealous senior developers intending to sneak in a quick code improvement into the increment. Having the sprint goal transparent helps the scrum team with holding each other accountable and reinforces focus during the sprint. Any member of the team can challenge new work by asking for an explanation on how it helps deliver the sprint goal. It's very simple, if it doesn't help the developers to deliver the sprint goals then it should not be picked up and such new work should be directed to the product owner.

5. **Inspect Progress towards the Product Goal:** It's a good practice for the product owner to give regular updates to the stakeholders; a set of delivered sprint goals, the increment and the Product Goal can altogether give a very good picture of how much progress has been made towards the Product Goal.


The Oxford dictionary defines effective as "successful in producing a desired or intended result." and for the Scrum Framework, an effective Scrum Team is one that is able to consistently deliver usable, useful and valuable increment to its users. Delivering the Sprint Goals consistently is a good leading indicator for an effective team.
