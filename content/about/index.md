An Agile Coach with experience of working with Leaders on Enterprise Agility and also 
working with Teams on their Agility Journey. My goal on every engagement is to help the people 
and the organisation at large develop an Agile Mindset; this mindset unlocks creativity at work, organisations are able to respond quicker and deliver value to it customers and ultimately we are able to create a work environment where people are happy to come to.

I have over 15 years experience in Applications Development and Delivery coupled with years of research on Agile Ways of Working including Psychologcal Safety at work. Even though i continue to research various Agile ways of Working including Scrum, SAFE, Kanban & Lean, I have remained largely agnostic. I am guided by an approach that has been applied across a varied number of industries.s

My domain experience include Media & Broadcasting, E-Commerce,  Government, Investment Banking &Finance, Insurance and Online Betting.
