A pragmatic problem solver with over 15 years experience in Product Development and Delivery; I have a massive interest in Agile / Lean ways of working. I have been described as an Agile Evangelist and recently taken on roles as an Agile Coach within Software Development Team. My previous work experiences as a Software Developer, Technical Tester, Test Manager and Release Manager has provided me a wholistic view which has been valuable to me as an Agile Coach / Consultant.

In my quest to solve business problems, I work with a organisation ranging from Start-ups to Large Corporations in and around Africa and in the UK. My domain experience include Media & Broadcasting, E-Commerce,  Government, Investment Banking & Finance, Insurance and Online Betting.
