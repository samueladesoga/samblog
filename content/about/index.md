An experienced consultant with about 15years under my belt; having started my career as a Software Developer using the traditional ways of developing software; I got re-introduced to Agile Ways of Working in 2007 whilst i was working for a renouned Consultancy in London; around the same time I started looking at technical ways of Software Testing within a Software Development. This lead me in test leadership roles and i am very big on ensuring that tests are distributed along the test pyramid layers. These days, I work as an Agile Consultant with my background in Software Development, Testing and Business Analysis helping me to have a holistic approach to improving the team's way of work.

I also run an IT Consulting firm in Lagos, which takes on Product Development work for different organisations from SMEs to Large Corporation. My domain experience include Media & Broadcasting, E-Commerce,  Government, Investment Banking & Finance, Insurance and Online Betting.
