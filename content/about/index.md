An Agile Management Consultant with varied experiences over the last 20 years.  My mission, as I understand it today, is enabling individuals, teams and whole organisations with capabilities that allow for building business agility within organisations. 


Reflecting on recently completed clients' engagements, I have discovered that many leaders reach out to me to help them deliver key initiatives, and my approach includes:

-	Helping to build the team’s maturity and capabilities to solve complex problems.
-	Supporting teams' to develop and own a holistic product testing strategy executed by the entire team.
-	Bringing focus to teams’ work and realignment to organisational strategy.
-	Embedding sound product management practices - spanning discovery, delivery and validation into teams.
-	Helping teams' adopt a continuous improvement and customer obsessed mindset, guided byu metrics built on the Evidence Based Management principles.


Previous job titles includes Software Developer, Software Developer in Test, Business Analysts, QA Automation Engineer, TestR / Release Manager, Scrum Master, Delivery Lead, Head of Delivery, Project Manager, PMO Manager and Product Owner. Working with one of the foremost agile consultancies in the world, [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) gave me an "expert generalist" background and I have remained technically minded throughout the years. (Here is a [github repo](https://github.com/samueladesoga) where you can explore some of my work.)


I have read a blog everyday since 2006 and I continue to research on topics such as: better ways of working and leading, behavioural economics, system thinking, complexity, psychological safety and goal setting frameworks such as OKRs. I have helped many organisations adopt Agile frameworks such as Scrum, SAFe, Kanban & Lean. I have remained largely agnostic in my methodds guided by an approach that has been applied across a varied number of industries.

My domain experience includes Media & Broadcasting, E-Commerce, Government, Investment Banking & Finance, Insurance, Capital Markets, FinTech, HealthTech, Banking, Online Betting and SaaS.
