The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

I am an experienced consultant with about 15years under my belt; having started my career as a Software Developer using the traditional ways of developing software; I got re-introduced to Agile Ways of Working in 2007 whilst i was working for a renouned Consultancy in London; around the same time I started looking at technical ways of Software Testing within a Software Development. This lead me in test leadership roles and i am very big on ensuring that tests are distributed along the test pyramid layers. These days, I work as an Agile Consultant with my background in Software Development, Testing and Business Analysis helping me to have a holistic approach to improving the team's way of work.

I also run an IT Consulting firm in Lagos, which takes on Product Development work for different organisations from SMEs to Large Corporation. My domain experience include Media & Broadcasting, E-Commerce,  Government, Investment Banking & Finance, Insurance and Online Betting.
